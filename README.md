# Car-Rental-System

-DMDD Academic Project

**Introduction:**
The management of vehicle inventory, reservations, interaction with customers, billing,
maintenance, insurance, and support is all intended to be streamlined by the car rental system.
By putting in place a strong database management system, the business intends to optimize
operations and give clients a hassle-free rental car experience.


**Business Problems Addressed:**

* Ineffective management of the vehicle inventory makes it difficult to keep track of
the available vehicles, their condition, and their maintenance history.
* Lack of centralized customer profiles, resulting in fragmented customer data and
suboptimal personalized services.
* An inefficient process for returns and inspections makes it difficult to record
damages and upkeep needs.
* Absence of transparent billing processes causing disorder and disputes with
customers.
* Inadequate customer service/support procedures cause delays in resolving issues,
which has a detrimental effect on client loyalty and satisfaction. The lack of a
centralized mechanism for handling support interactions worsens the situation.
